# NBA-Game-Summary
 The NBA Game Summary Generator uses statistical data from NBA games to generate human-like game summaries. The goal is to create an interactive web app where users can select a recent game, and the app will produce a recap that highlights key players, turning points, and standout performances. This project will help develop skills in data wrangling, natural language generation, and web development.
